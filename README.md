# Botanists Assistant Frontend

This is a simple react-frontend bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

It should be relatively simple to get things running straight away. The only thing you need to take into account is that you need to have a `.env` file with a backend api address included. An example can be found in this repository pointing to a local backend.

## On data-fetching and api calls

This application provides two ways to store and fetch data persistently. First one is an adapter against local storage, the other with api calls to this [companion rest api](https://github.com/juliusrajala/plant-backend).
